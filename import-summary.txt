ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

 * Project
   BaiduWalletRefactorLib:C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\pingpp-android-master\l
   b\bdwallet_pay_sdk\.classpath:
   Could not resolve source path src in project BaiduWalletRefactorLib: ignored.
   The project may not compile if the given source path provided source code.


Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* ic_launcher-web.png
* proguard-project.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => baiduWalletRefactorLib\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* libs\armeabi\libbd_wsp_v1_0.so => baiduWalletRefactorLib\src\main\jniLibs\armeabi\libbd_wsp_v1_0.so
* libs\Cashier_SDK-v4.2.0.jar => baiduWalletRefactorLib\libs\Cashier_SDK-v4.2.0.jar
* res\ => baiduWalletRefactorLib\src\main\res\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
